# TESTING-FINDINGS.md — manual-test findings log

> Fill this in while working through `docs/MANUAL-TESTING.md`. One block per issue, copy the
> template. Don't self-censor — "button feels cramped" is a valid finding. When ready, tell
> Claude **"process the findings"**: each OPEN item becomes a fix (with a regression test where
> it's a real bug), severities drive order, and STATUS gets updated back into this file.

**Severity:** `S1` broken/wrong data/blocks the client demo · `S2` works but wrong behavior or
confusing enough to embarrass us · `S3` polish (spacing, copy, speed) · `IDEA` not a defect —
something the client will probably ask for (gets an R2-NN and goes through the plan folder,
NOT silently built).

**Status:** `OPEN` → `FIXED (commit)` / `WONTFIX (why)` / `PLANNED (R2-NN)`.
